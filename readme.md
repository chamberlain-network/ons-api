ONS-APi

The UKâ€™s Office for National Statistics (ONS) API is a powerful tool for accessing a wealth of data on various aspects of the economy, society, and environment. 

As one of the most authoritative sources of statistical information in the UK, the ONS provides open access to datasets that cover a wide range of categories, including demographics, economic performance, health, education, and employment. Among the most valuable and frequently used data categories is jobs data, which provides insights into the labor market, employment trends, and workforce characteristics across the UK. 

This App fetches the various categories available through the ONS API, with a particular focus on the rich and dynamic data related to jobs.
